# Net Pay Calculator 💻

Hey there! 👋

This repository contains **my personal implementation** of the Net Pay Calculator project from Introduction to Programming II (COS 211) in my 200-level Cybersecurity program.

### 📖 My Journey Behind This Project
In my First year, we took Introduction to Programming I, where we learned C programming. It was my first deep dive into low-level logic, memory management, and structured thinking. While I'm still honing my skills (pointers and manual memory handling continue to challenge me), it laid an unbreakable foundation.

In my Sophomore year, Introduction to Programming II introduced us to Java — a more abstract, object-oriented paradigm. This project marked one of our early practical assignments: creating a console application to compute gross pay, tax, and net pay based on user inputs. It solidified essentials like variables, input handling with Scanner, arithmetic operations, output formatting, and the critical practice of thorough commenting to demonstrate true understanding.

I had the opportunity to serve as the Leader for Team 1 on this project. The experience taught me invaluable lessons in collaboration, accountability, and clear communication — lessons that extended far beyond the realm of syntax. Every line of code in this repository is my own: intentionally written, meticulously commented, and refined to embody my commitment to clarity, purpose, and continuous growth.

### 🚀 What This Project Covers
- User input for hours worked, hourly wage, and tax rate
- Accurate calculations: gross pay → tax deduction → net pay
- Clean, formatted output (2 decimal places for currency-like readability)
- Comprehensive line-by-line comments explaining logic, decisions, and possible extrapolations
- No external dependencies — pure Java fundamentals

### 🛠️ Tech & Tools
- **Language**: Java (JDK 25 — latest stable release)
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

### 🌱 What I Learned & Next Steps
This project wasn’t just coursework — it was a milestone in translating real-world problems into structured, maintainable code. It reinforced clean coding practices and deepened my appreciation for readable, purposeful programs. Moving forward, I'm excited to explore Java's object-oriented features while continuing to strengthen my C foundation.

Every commit here aligns with my broader vision: **build securely, learn continuously, share purposefully**.
